# URL to QR Code Coverter
This extension generates a QR code for current page URL, so that if you want to view the same web page in mobile by simply scanning it, instead of typing the whole URL by hand or ```Ctrl+c``` and then ```Ctrl+v``` ðŸ˜– into another application.

# Installation
  * Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
  
  * The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.
  
  * Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
  
  * Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.
  
  * Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed. Because no icons were included in the manifest, a generic toolbar icon will be created for the extension.
